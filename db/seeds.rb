Document.create title: "The Rat Story", body: <<~HEREDOC
    In Shostka in 1885, the Mousekewitzes, a Russian-Jewish family of mice who
    live with a human family named Moskowitz, are having a celebration of
    Hanukkah where Papa gives his hat to his 5-year-old son, Fievel, and tells
    him about the United States, a country where there are no cats. The
    celebration is interrupted when a battery of Cossacks ride through the
    village square in an anti-Jewish arson attack and their cats likewise
    attack the village mice.  Because of this, the Moskowitz home, along with
    that of the Mousekewitzes, is destroyed.

    In Hamburg, the Mousekewitzes board a tramp steamer headed for New York
    City.  All the mice aboard are ecstatic at the process of going to America
    as there are "no cats" there. During a thunderstorm on their journey,
    Fievel suddenly finds himself separated from his family and washed
    overboard. Thinking that he has died, they proceed to the city as planned,
    though they become depressed at his loss.

    However, Fievel floats to New York City in a bottle and, after a pep talk
    from a French pigeon named Henri, embarks on a quest to find his family. He
    is waylaid by conman Warren T. Rat, who gains his trust and then sells him
    to a sweatshop. He escapes with Tony Toponi, a street-smart Italian mouse,
    and they join up with Bridget, an Irish mouse trying to rouse her fellow
    mice to fight the cats. When a gang of them called the Mott Street Maulers
    attacks a mouse marketplace, the immigrant mice learn that the tales of a
    cat-free country are not true.

    Bridget takes Fievel and Tony to see Honest John, an alcoholic politician
    who knows the city's voting mice. However, he can't help Fievel search for
    his family, as they have not yet registered to vote. Meanwhile, his older
    sister, Tanya, tells her gloomy parents she has a feeling that he is still
    alive, but they insist that it will eventually go away.

    Led by the rich and powerful Gussie Mausheimer, the mice hold a rally to
    decide what to do about the cats. Warren is extorting them all for
    protection that he never provides. No one knows what to do about it, until
    Fievel whispers a plan to Gussie. Although his family also attends, they
    stand well in the back of the audience and they are unable to recognize
    Fievel onstage with her.

    The mice take over an abandoned museum on the Chelsea Piers and begin
    constructing their plan. On the day of launch, Fievel gets lost and
    stumbles upon the Maulers' lair. He discovers Warren there and that he is
    actually a small cat in disguise and the leader of the Maulers. They
    discover, capture and imprison Fievel, but his guard is a reluctant member
    of the gang, a goofy, soft-hearted long-haired orange tabby cat named
    Tiger, who befriends and frees him.

    Fievel races back to the pier with the cats chasing after him. There the
    disguised Warren attempts to extort the mice again to surrender Fievel and
    their money in exchange for their safety, but when Tony removes Warren's
    disguise in front of the mice with the aid of a slingshot, they defiantly
    refuse. Warren then sets fire to the pier's entrance in an attempt to burn
    the mice alive, until Gussie finally orders the mice to release the secret
    weapon.  A huge mechanical mouse, inspired by the bedtime tales Papa told
    Fievel of the "Giant Mouse of Minsk", chases Warren and his gang down the
    pier and into the water. A tramp steamer bound for Hong Kong picks them up
    on its anchor and carries them away. However, a pile of leaking kerosene
    cans has caused remnants of the fire Warren had started to ignite the
    entire pier, and the mice are forced to flee when the human fire department
    arrives to extinguish it.

    During the fire, Fievel is once again separated from his family and ends up
    at an orphanage. Papa and Tanya overhear Bridget and Tony calling out to
    Fievel, but Papa is sure that there may be another "Fievel" somewhere,
    until Mama finds his hat.

    Joined by Gussie, Tiger allows them to ride him in a final effort to find
    Fievel and they are ultimately successful. The journey ends with Henri
    taking everyone to see his newly completed projectâ€”the Statue of Liberty,
    which appears to smile and wink at Fievel and Tanya, and the Mouskewitzes'
    new life in the United States begins.

    During the age of the dinosaurs, a massive famine forces several herds of
    dinosaurs to seek an oasis known as the Great Valley. Among these, a mother
    in a diminished "longneck" herd gives birth to a single baby, named
    Littlefoot. Years later, Littlefoot plays with Cera, a "three-horn", until
    her father intervenes, whereupon Littlefoot's mother describes the
    different kinds of dinosaurs: "three-horns", "spiketails", "swimmers", and
    "flyers". That night, as Littlefoot follows a "hopper", he encounters Cera
    again, and they play together briefly until a large "Sharptooth" attacks
    them. Littlefoot's mother comes to their rescue, but receives fatal
    injuries in the process. An earthquake swallows up the Sharptooth and
    divides Littlefoot and Cera from their herds. Littlefoot receives advice
    from his dying mother before she passes away. Confused and in grief,
    Littlefoot meets an old "clubtail" named Rooter, who consoles him. He is
    then guided by his mother's voice telling him to follow the sun to the
    Great Valley.

    Later, Littlefoot meets a "bigmouth" named Ducky and a flyer named Petrie,
    who accompany him on his journey. Cera, who is attempting to find her own
    kind, finds the unconscious Sharptooth inside a ravine and mistakenly wakes
    him up. She escapes and bumps into Littlefoot, Ducky, and Petrie; she tells
    them that the Sharptooth is alive, but Littlefoot does not believe her. As
    Cera describes her encounter, she accidentally flings Ducky to the
    direction of a lone hatching spiketail, whom she names Spike and inducts
    into the group. Seeking the Great Valley, they discover a cluster of trees,
    which is abruptly depleted by a herd of Longnecks. Searching for remaining
    growth, they discover a single leaf-bearing tree, and obtain food by
    stacking up atop each other and pulling it down. Cera remains aloof, but at
    nightfall, everyone including herself gravitates to Littlefoot's side for
    warmth and companionship.

    The next morning, they are attacked by the Sharptooth, but they escape
    through a tunnel too small for him. Beyond this, they discover landmarks
    mentioned by Littlefoot's mother. Cera stubbornly decides to go another
    way, but Littlefoot refuses, and their ensuing fight leads to a schism that
    divides him from the others. However, when Ducky and Spike become
    endangered by lava and Petrie gets stuck in a tar pit, he returns to rescue
    them. They then rescue Cera as she is being ambushed by a pack of
    "domeheads". Ashamed of her fear and behavior, and reluctant to admit her
    mistake, Cera leaves them in tears. Later, while crossing a pond, Petrie
    overhears the Sharptooth nearby. The group devises a scheme to lure him to
    the pond and drown him in the deep side using a nearby boulder. During the
    ensuing struggle, a draft from the Sharptooth's nostrils enables Petrie to
    fly for the first time.

    The plan nearly fails when the Sharptooth begins attacking the boulder
    while the group attempts to push it onto him. However, Cera reunites with
    the group, and she allows them to push the Sharptooth and the boulder into
    the water below. The Sharptooth momentarily takes Petrie down with him, but
    he later emerges unharmed. Littlefoot, alone, follows a cloud resembling
    his mother, which guides him to the Great Valley. He is then joined by the
    others. Upon arrival, the five are reunited with their families: Petrie
    impresses his family with his newfound flight; Ducky introduces Spike to
    her family, who adopt him; Cera reunites with her father; and Littlefoot
    rejoins with his grandparents. The group then rejoins at the top of a hill
    and embrace each other in a hug.

Document.create title: "The Fall of the Great King Scar", body: <<~HEREDOC
    In the Pride Lands of Africa, a pride of lions rule over the animal kingdom
    from Pride Rock. King Mufasa's and Queen Sarabi's newborn son, Simba (whose
    name is Swahili for lion[4]), is presented to the gathering animals by
    Rafiki the baboon (with the colorful facial marking of a mandrill)[5] who
    serves as the shaman and advisor. Mufasa shows Simba the Pride Lands and
    explains to him the responsibilities of kingship and the "circle of life",
    which connects all living things. Mufasa's younger brother, Scar, covets
    the throne and plots to eliminate Mufasa and Simba, so he may become king.
    He tricks Simba and his best friend Nala (to whom Simba is betrothed) into
    exploring a forbidden elephants' graveyard, where they are attacked by
    three spotted hyenas, Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed, who are in league with Scar.
    Mufasa is alerted about the incident by his majordomo, the hornbill Zazu,
    and rescues the cubs. Though upset with Simba, Mufasa forgives him and
    explains that the great kings of the past watch over them from the night
    sky, from which he will one day watch over Simba.

    Scar sets a trap for his brother and nephew, luring Simba into a gorge and
    having the hyenas drive a large herd of wildebeest into a stampede that
    will trample him. He informs Mufasa of Simba's peril, knowing that the king
    will rush to save his son. Mufasa saves Simba but ends up hanging
    perilously from the gorge's edge. Scar refuses to help Mufasa, instead
    sending him falling to his death. He then convinces Simba that the tragedy
    was Simba's own fault and advises him to leave the kingdom and never
    return. He orders the hyenas to kill the cub, but Simba escapes. Scar tells
    the pride that both Mufasa and Simba were killed in the stampede and steps
    forward as the new king, allowing his three hyena minions and the rest of
    their large pack to live in the Pride Lands.

    Simba collapses in a desert and is rescued by Timon and Pumbaa, a meerkat
    and warthog, who are fellow outcasts. Simba grows up in the jungle with his
    two new friends, living a carefree life under the motto "hakuna matata"
    ("no worries" in Swahili). Now a young adult, Simba rescues Timon and
    Pumbaa from a hungry lioness, who turns out to be Nala. She and Simba
    reunite and fall in love, and she urges him to return home, telling him
    that Pride Lands have become a drought-stricken wasteland under Scar's
    reign. Feeling guilty over his father's death, Simba refuses and storms
    off. He then encounters Rafiki, who tells him that Mufasa's spirit lives on
    in Simba. Simba is visited by the ghost of Mufasa in the night sky, who
    tells him that he must take his rightful place as king. Realizing that he
    can no longer run from his past, Simba decides to return to the Pride
    Lands.

    Aided by his friends, Simba sneaks past the hyenas at Pride Rock and
    confronts Scar, who had just struck Sarabi. Scar taunts Simba over his role
    in Mufasa's death and backs him to the edge of the rock, where he reveals
    to him that he murdered Mufasa. Enraged, Simba pins Scar to the ground and
    forces him to reveal the truth to the rest of the pride. Timon, Pumbaa,
    Rafiki, Zazu, and the lionesses fend off the hyenas while Scar, attempting
    to escape, is cornered by Simba at the top of Pride Rock. Scar begs for
    mercy and attempts to blame the hyenas for his actions; Simba spares his
    life, but orders him to leave the Pride Lands forever (just like Scar
    demanded Simba to do when he was a cub). Scar attacks his nephew, but Simba
    manages to toss him from the top of the rock. Scar survives the fall, but
    is attacked and killed by the hyenas, who overheard his attempt to betray
    them. Afterwards, Simba takes over the kingship as rain begins to fall. He
    also makes Nala his queen.

    Later, with Pride Rock restored to its usual state, Rafiki presents Simba
    and Nala's newborn cub to the assembled animals, continuing the circle of
    life.
